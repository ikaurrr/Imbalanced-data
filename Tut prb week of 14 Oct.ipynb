    "# Tutorial Problem: Week of 14 Oct 2024. Handling Imbalanced Datasets Using Sampling Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective:\n",
    "In this exercise, you will learn to handle imbalanced datasets using different sampling techniques and analyze how they affect model performance. You will use oversampling, undersampling, and hybrid methods to balance the dataset and evaluate their impact on model metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Dataset Selection:\n",
    "- Find an imbalanced dataset with a small number of classes (preferably binary classification) on platforms like GitHub or Kaggle. \n",
    "- Sample dataset: url= https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Preprocessing:\n",
    "- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Balancing the Dataset:\n",
    "- Apply the following techniques to handle class imbalance:\n",
    "  - Random Oversampling\n",
    "  - Random Undersampling\n",
    "  - Tomek Links\n",
    "  - SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)\n",
    "  - Class Weighing\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Model Training:\n",
    "- Train any one machine learning model (e.g., SVM, LDA, Decision Tree, etc.) on the original imbalanced dataset as well as the balanced datasets generated by each technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Performance Evaluation:\n",
    "- Compute the following performance metrics for each model:\n",
    "  - Accuracy\n",
    "  - F1 Score\n",
    "  - AUC (Area Under the Curve)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Comparison:\n",
    "- Compare the performance metrics across the different sampling techniques and the original dataset.\n",
    "- Identify which technique led to the best improvement in model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Submission:\n",
    "- Create a GitHub repository for this assignment, and make it public.\n",
    "- Upload your dataset, code, and results to the repository.\n",
    "- Share the link to your GitHub repo with the instructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deliverables:\n",
    "- Balanced dataset using different techniques.\n",
    "- Model performance comparison table.\n",
    "- GitHub repo link containing the code, dataset, and analysis.\n"
